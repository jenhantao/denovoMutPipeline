Notes:

TCGA barcodes identify individuals
Example:
    TCGA-44-2665-01A-01D-1040-01
    
    - TCGA-44-2665 serves as a unique identifier of the individual
    - 01A specifies that this sample comes from a primary tumor
    - The rest has to do with sample handling and can be ignored
    - More info at: https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/TCGA+Barcode


Each TCGA barcode in TCGA_samples_with_three_types.summary should be associated with at least 3 tissue samples
1) 01 Primary tumor
2) 10 Blood
3) 11 Normal tissue

Some TCGA barcodes have more than 3 associated samples (see samplesByBarcode.txt)
=> Different blood samples are expected to share the same variants (differences from the reference genome)
=> Different tumor samples for the same individual are not expected to share the same somatic mutations (differences from the blood) due to heterogeneity within the tumor
** We should think about how we can take advantage of individuals like this. Offhand, I would expect a denovo mutation to show up in all the tumor and normal tissue samples and none of the blood samples. One caveat is that they may have taken multiple samples because of data quality issues as well.


# Data preprocessing
1) Created data/denovo/meta.txt from data/denovo/TCGA_samples_with_three_types.summary
$ awk -F $'\t' 'BEGIN {OFS = FS} {print $2,$2,"https://cghub.ucsc.edu/cghub/data/analysis/download/"$17,$11,$8}' TCGA_samples_with_three_types.summary > meta.txt
-> Edited column 2 to retain only tissue code
s


2) Created pipeline calls
$ cd ~/projects/pipeline
$ tasks/callPipe -f data/denovo/meta.txt -d ~/mnt -p denovo > denovo.run

3) Check pipeline configuration
-> Make sure that variants are being called for the whole exome


# MuTect
Notes:

For each triangle (TP,NB,NT) run MuTect three times:
TP vs NB -> catalogue of differences between tumor and blood
TP vs NT -> catalogue of differences between tumor and normal tissue
NT vs NB -> catalogue of differences between blood and normal tissue

Limitation: MuTect does not give germline variation, just somatic mutations
=> There will be no variants falling into the "= = =" category
